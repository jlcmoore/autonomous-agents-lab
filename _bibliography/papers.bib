 abstract = {We introduce ThreeDWorld (TDW), a platform for interactive multi-modal physical simulation. TDW enables simulation of high-fidelity sensory data and physical interactions between mobile agents and objects in rich 3D environments. Unique properties include: real-time near-photo-realistic image rendering; a library of objects and environments, and routines for their customization; generative procedures for efficiently building classes of new environments; high-fidelity audio rendering; realistic physical interactions for a variety of material types, including cloths, liquid, and deformable objects; customizable agents that embody AI agents; and support for human interactions with VR devices. TDW's API enables multiple agents to interact within a simulation and returns a range of sensor and physics data representing the state of the world. We present initial experiments enabled by TDW in emerging research directions in computer vision, machine learning, and cognitive science, including multi-modal physical scene understanding, physical dynamics predictions, multi-agent interactions, models that learn like a child, and attention studies in humans and neural networks.},

 abstract = {Infants are experts at playing, with an amazing ability to generate novel structured behaviors in unstructured environments that lack clear extrinsic reward signals. We seek to mathematically formalize these abilities using a neural network that implements curiosity-driven intrinsic motivation. Using a simple but ecologically naturalistic simulated environment in which an agent can move and interact with objects it sees, we propose a" world-model" network that learns to predict the dynamic consequences of the agent's actions. Simultaneously, we train a separate explicit" self-model" that allows the agent to track the error map of its world-model. It then uses the self-model to adversarially challenge the developing world-model. We demonstrate that this policy causes the agent to explore novel and informative interactions with its environment, leading to the generation of a spectrum of complex behaviors, including ego-motion prediction, object attention, and object gathering. Moreover, the world-model that the agent learns supports improved performance on object dynamics prediction, detection, localization and recognition tasks. Taken together, our results are initial steps toward creating flexible autonomous agents that self-supervise in realistic physical environments.},

 abstract = {Inductive reasoning is a core problem-solving capacity: humans can identify underlying principles from a few examples, which can then be robustly generalized to novel scenarios. Recent work has evaluated large language models (LLMs) on inductive reasoning tasks by directly prompting them yielding "in context learning." This can work well for straightforward inductive tasks, but performs very poorly on more complex tasks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this work, we propose to improve the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs by generating explicit hypotheses at multiple levels of abstraction: we prompt the LLM to propose multiple abstract hypotheses about the problem, in natural language, then implement the natural language hypotheses as concrete Python programs. These programs can be directly verified by running on the observed examples and generalized to novel inputs. Because of the prohibitive cost of generation with state-of-the-art LLMs, we consider a middle step to filter the set of hypotheses that will be implemented into programs: we either ask the LLM to summarize into a smaller set of hypotheses, or ask human annotators to select a subset of the hypotheses. We verify our pipeline's effectiveness on the ARC visual inductive reasoning benchmark, its variant 1D-ARC, and string transformation dataset SyGuS. On a random 40-problem subset of ARC, our automated pipeline using LLM summaries achieves 27.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming the direct prompting baseline (accuracy of 12.5%).

@article{zelikman_quiet-star:_2024,
 abstract = {When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting -- ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought's start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM's ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of …},

 abstract = {Despite recent success in large language model (LLM) reasoning, LLMs struggle with hierarchical multi-step reasoning tasks like generating complex programs. For these tasks, humans often start with a high-level algorithmic design and implement each part gradually. We introduce Parsel, a framework enabling automatic implementation and validation of complex algorithms with code LLMs. With Parsel, we automatically decompose algorithmic tasks into hierarchical natural language function descriptions and then search over combinations of possible function implementations using tests. We show that Parsel can be used across domains requiring hierarchical reasoning, including program synthesis and robotic planning. We find that, using Parsel, LLMs solve more competition-level problems in the APPS dataset, resulting in pass rates over 75\% higher than prior results from directly sampling AlphaCode and Codex, while often using a smaller sample budget. Moreover, with automatically generated tests, we find that Parsel can improve the state-of-the-art pass@ 1 performance on HumanEval from 67\% to 85\%. We also find that LLM-generated robotic plans using Parsel are more than twice as likely to be considered accurate than directly generated plans. Lastly, we explore how Parsel addresses LLM limitations and discuss how Parsel may be useful for human programmers. We release our code at https://github. com/ezelikman/parsel.},

We evaluate workers when crowdsourcing the task of providing categorical ordinal behavioral ratings to unstructured public YouTube videos of children with autism and neurotypical controls. To evaluate emerging patterns that are consistent across independent crowds, we target workers from distinct geographic loci on two crowdsourcing platforms: an international group of workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (N = 15) and Microworkers from Bangladesh (N = 56), Kenya (N = 23), and the Philippines (N = 25).

Crowdsourcing approaches may provide a scalable alternative that can accelerate general access to care and permit underserved populations to obtain an accurate diagnosis.We aimed to perform a series of studies to explore whether paid crowd workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and citizen crowd workers on a public website shared on social media can provide accurate online detection of autism, conducted via crowdsourced ratings of short home video clips.Three online studies were performed: (1) a paid crowdsourcing task on AMT (N=54) where crowd workers were asked to classify 10 short video clips of children as “Autism” or “Not autism,” (2) a more complex paid crowdsourcing task (N=27) with only those raters who correctly rated ≥8 of the 10 videos during the first study, and (3) a public unpaid study (N=115) identical to the first study.For Study 1, the mean score of the participants who completed all questions was 7.50/10 (SD 1.46). When only analyzing the workers who scored ≥8/10 (n=27/54), there was a weak negative correlation between the time spent rating the videos and the sensitivity (ρ=–0.44, P=.02). For Study 2, the mean score of the participants rating new videos was 6.76/10 (SD 0.59). The average deviation between the crowdsourced answers and gold standard ratings provided by two expert clinical research coordinators was 0.56, with an SD …},

ASD consists of social deficiencies, such as impaired communication, eye contact, facial expression recognition, and social interaction. The current standard of care, applied behavioral analysis (ABA), relies on teaching these skills primarily in clinical environments with tools such as static flashcards. Such tools are largely removed from real world emotional contexts. While ABA can lead to improvements [1, 2], the therapy often generalizes poorly to situations that extend beyond the routines practiced in clinical contexts [3]. Furthermore, access to such treatment is constrained by the availability of therapists, who struggle to keep up with the increasing demand for care.},

ChatGPT (with GPT-4) was queried to solve a total of 40 problems from a college-level engineering physics course. These problems ranged from well-specified problems, where all data required for solving the problem was provided, to under-specified, real-world problems where not all necessary data were given. Our findings show that ChatGPT could successfully solve 62.5% of the well-specified problems, but its accuracy drops to 8.3% for under-specified problems. Analysis of the model's incorrect solutions revealed three distinct failure modes: (1) failure to construct accurate models of the physical world, (2) failure to make reasonable assumptions about missing data, and (3) calculation errors. The study offers implications for how to leverage LLM-augmented instructional materials to enhance STEM education.

These features, designed to encode shape and texture information, depend on both (1) the expression an individual is making, and (2) the individual's physical characteristics and lighting conditions of the image.

We seek to replicate some of these abilities with a neural network that implements curiosity-driven intrinsic motivation. Using a simple but ecologically naturalistic simulated environment in which the agent can move and interact with objects it sees, the agent learns a world model predicting the dynamic consequences of its actions. Simultaneously, the agent learns to take actions that adversarially challenge the developing world model, pushing the agent to explore novel and informative interactions with its environment. We demonstrate that this policy leads to the self-supervised emergence of a spectrum of complex behaviors, including ego motion prediction, object attention, and object gathering. Moreover, the world model that the agent learns supports improved performance on object dynamics prediction and localization tasks. Our results are a proof-of-principle that computational models of intrinsic motivation might account for key features of developmental visuomotor learning in infants.},

Physiological and three axis acceleration data were collected concurrent with coding of aggressive behavior. Physiological arousal was measured by: 1) heart rate and heart rate variability, both derived from blood volume pulse (BVP) and interbeat interval (IBI) via photoplethysmography at 64 Hz; and 2) electrodermal activity (EDA), which reflects autonomic innervation of sweat glands. Advanced signal processing and machine learning algorithms were then applied to predict aggression onset. The area under the curve (AUC) accuracy (based on true/false positive rates) was calculated to predict the onset of aggression in the next one minute from present time (t). The predictions were made through a ridge-regularized logistic regression using: 1) previous t ¼ 3 minutes of motor movement acceleration (ACC) signals; 2) time elapsed since last aggression event; 3) previous t ¼ 3 minutes of BVP, EDA, and IBI signals; and 4) all of the above signals combined.Results: All youth tolerated the sensor after desensitization, usable data were obtained in all cases, and there was an average of 9.67 (range ¼ 0-44) aggressive episodes per four-hour observation period.

(2023), using shared randomness to perform distributed fine-tuning with low bandwidth. The method is a natural decentralized extension of memory-efficient Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA). Each iteration, each machine seeds a Random Number Generator (RNG) to perform local reproducible perturbations on model weights and calculate and exchange scalar projected gradients, which are then used to update each model. By using a (machine, sample) identifier as the random seed, each model can regenerate one another's perturbations. As machines only exchange single-byte projected gradients, this is highly communication efficient. There are also potential privacy benefits, as projected gradients may be calculated on different training data, and models never access the other's data. Our approach not only drastically reduces communication bandwidth requirements but also accommodates dynamic addition or removal of machines during the training process and retains the memory-efficient and inference-only advantages of recent work. We perform proof-of-concept experiments to demonstrate the potential usefulness of this method, building off of rich literature on distributed optimization and memory-efficient training.},

 abstract = {Standard medical diagnosis of mental health conditions often requires licensed experts who are increasingly outnumbered by those at risk, limiting reach. We test the hypothesis that a trustworthy crowd of non-experts can efficiently label features needed for accurate machine learning detection of the common childhood developmental disorder autism. We implement a novel process for creating a trustworthy distributed workforce for video feature extraction, selecting a workforce of 102 workers from a pool of 1,107. Two previously validated binary autism logistic regression classifiers were used to evaluate the quality of the curated crowd’s ratings on unstructured home videos. A clinically representative balanced sample (N=50 videos) of videos were evaluated with and without face box and pitch shift privacy alterations, with AUROC and AUPRC scores >0.98. With both privacy-preserving modifications, sensitivity is preserved (96.0%) while maintaining specificity (80.0%) and accuracy (88.0%) at levels that exceed classification methods without alterations. We find that machine learning classification from features extracted by a curated nonexpert crowd achieves clinical performance for pediatric autism videos and maintains acceptable performance when privacy-preserving mechanisms are applied. These results suggest that privacy-based crowdsourcing of short videos can be leveraged for rapid and mobile assessment of behavioral health.},

@article{haber_a_2020,
 abstract = {With most recent estimates giving an incidence rate of 1 in 68 children in the United States, the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a growing public health crisis. Many of these children struggle to make eye contact, recognize facial expressions, and engage in social interactions. Today the standard for treatment of the core autism-related deficits focuses on a form of behavior training known as Applied Behavioral Analysis. To address perceived deficits in expression recognition, ABA approaches routinely involve the use of prompts such as flash cards for repetitive emotion recognition training via memorization. These techniques must be administered by trained practitioners and often at clinical centers that are far outnumbered by and out of reach from the many children and families in need of attention. Waitlists for access are up to 18 months long, and this wait may lead to children regressing down a path of isolation that worsens their long-term prognosis. There is an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices for use outside of clinical settings.},

Driven by our own curiosity, we learn about object motion and properties via self-curated targeted experiments, that teach us what we do not know. Recently, neural network models have been proposed that learn forward object dynamics from observations like humans. Unlike humans, these models do not actively interact with surrounding objects but learn from human-curated datasets as passive observers. In this work-in-progress, we propose a closed-loop system that teaches itself about forward object dynamics without any human intervention. Our model consists of two parts. A forward dynamics model that models the transition between states and a policy model that tries to predict the dynamics model’s error conditioned on object interactions as its intrinsic reward. We show that our method is able to train forward dynamics models that generalize to unseen physical scenarios and approaches the upper bound of models trained on human-curated data. The model generates complex behaviors with a preference to novel objects.},

However, putting a model in production involves much more than just generating an output. It involves ensuring the model is reliable, safe, performant and also adheres to the policy of operation in a particular domain. Guardrails as a necessity for models has evolved around the need to enforce appropriate behavior of models, especially when they are in production. In this paper, we use education as a use case, given its stringent requirements of the appropriateness of content in the domain, to demonstrate how a guardrail model can be trained and deployed in production. Specifically, we describe our experience in building a production-grade guardrail model for a K-12 educational platform. We begin by formulating the requirements for deployment to this sensitive domain. We then describe the training and benchmarking of our domain-specific guardrail model, which outperforms competing open- and closed- instruction-tuned models of similar and larger size, on proprietary education-related benchmarks and public benchmarks related to general aspects of safety. Finally, we detail the choices we made on architecture and the optimizations for deploying this service in production; these range across the stack from the hardware infrastructure to the serving layer to language model inference optimizations. We hope this paper will be instructive to other practitioners looking to create production-grade domain-specific services based on generative AI and large language models.},

A crucial aspect of ContextRef is that images and descriptions are presented in context, reflecting prior work showing that context is important for description quality. Using ContextRef, we assess a variety of pretrained models, scoring functions, and techniques for incorporating context. None of the methods is successful with ContextRef, but we show that careful fine-tuning yields substantial improvements.

While recent work, eg, Reflexion, has demonstrated how such agents can also self-improve by adding a textual memory of “hints” learned from prior experience, such improvements have been limited both in size and scope. In contrast, our goal is a language agent that can robustly improve performance over time, including when both the task and environment are varied. Our approach is to have the agent learn a textual representation of how the world works (rather than just isolated hints), expressed as a memory of causal abstractions, to guide future decision-making. In experiments, we find CLIN is able to continually improve on repeated trials on the same task and environment, outperforming state-of-the-art reflective language agents like Reflexion by 23 points in ScienceWorld and 1.4 points in ALFWorld benchmarks. CLIN can also transfer its learning to new environments and tasks, enhancing performance by 21 points in ScienceWorld and 11 points in ALFWorld. This suggests that language agents with a textual causal memory can play a significant role in interactive environments, including being able to rapidly improve over time.},

We find that the single best predictor of human responses is adversarial reward, a model derived from physical prediction loss. We also find that simple scene feature models do not generalize their prediction of human responses across all scenarios. Finally, linearly combining the adversarial model with the number of collisions in a scene leads to the greatest improvement in predictivity of human responses, suggesting humans are driven towards scenarios that result in high information gain and physical activity.},

Our research examines these considerations by studying how and why college students use genAI tools in their STEM coursework, focusing on their problem-solving support. We surveyed 40 STEM college students from diverse U.S. institutions and 28 STEM faculty to understand instructor perspectives on effective genAI tool use and guidance in STEM courses.

The most common use cases include finding explanations, exploring related topics, summarizing readings, and helping with problem-set questions. The primary motivation for using genAI tools was to save time. Moreover, over half of student participants reported simply inputting problems for AI to generate solutions, potentially bypassing their own problem-solving processes. These findings indicate that despite high adoption rates, students' current approaches to utilizing genAI tools often fall short in enhancing their own STEM problem-solving competencies.

Exploiting the structural modularity specific to coded simulations, we propose to use a factored partially observable Markov decision process representation that allows us to reduce context dependence during each step of the generation. For evaluation, we introduce a generative simulation benchmark that assesses the generated simulation code’s accuracy and effectiveness in facilitating zero-shot transfers in reinforcement learning settings. We show that FACTORSIM outperforms existing methods in generating simulations regarding prompt alignment (i.e., accuracy), zero-shot transfer abilities, and human evaluation. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in generating robotic tasks.},

However, effectively utilizing these resources to achieve targeted learning goals can be challenging. Unlike direct tutoring, video content lacks tailored guidance based on individual learning paces, personalized feedback, and interactive engagement necessary for support and monitoring. Our work transforms programming videos into one-on-one tutoring experiences using the cognitive apprenticeship framework. Tutorly, developed as a JupyterLab Plugin, allows learners to (1) set personalized learning goals, (2) engage in learning-by-doing through a conversational LLM-based mentor agent, (3) receive guidance and feedback based on a student model that steers the mentor moves. In a within-subject study with 16 participants learning exploratory data analysis from a streamcast, Tutorly significantly improved their performance from 61.9% to 76.6% based on a post-test questionnaire.

Humans tend to predict the future based on expected events rather than simulating step-by-step. Thus, our benchmark includes a cognitively-inspired evaluation pipeline designed to assess whether the simulated trajectories of world models capture the correct sequences of events. To perform well, models need to leverage predictive cues from the observations to accurately simulate the goals of animate agents over long horizons.

Traditional attachment research has been qualitative, lacking a model to explain how infants' attachment styles develop from experience and how these are influenced by personal traits and environmental factors. We propose such a model, predicting how infants balance interaction with caregivers against exploring their surroundings. Our study is based in a grid-world environment containing an infant and caregiver agent. We vary the infant’s temperamental factors (e.g., ability to regulate emotions and preferences for social vs. environmental reward), and caregiver behavior (whether positive or negative interactions are more likely). We find that different equilibria result that qualitatively correspond to different attachment styles. Our findings suggest that the characteristic exploratory behavior of each attachment style in real infants may arise from interactions of infant temperament and caregiver behaviors.},

@article{xiang_from_2023,
 abstract = {In real-world environments, autonomous agents rely on their egocentric observations. They must learn adaptive strategies to interact with others who possess mixed motivations, discernible only through visible cues. Several Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods adopt centralized approaches that involve either centralized training or reward-sharing, often violating the realistic ways in which living organisms, like animals or humans, process information and interact. MARL strategies deploying decentralized training with intrinsic motivation offer a self-supervised approach, enable agents to develop flexible social strategies through the interaction of autonomous agents. However, by contrasting the self-supervised and centralized methods, we reveal that populations trained with reward-sharing methods surpass those using self-supervised methods in a mixed-motive environment. We link this superiority to specialized role emergence and an agent's expertise in its role. Interestingly, this gap shrinks in pure-motive settings, emphasizing the need for evaluations in more complex, realistic environments (mixed-motive). Our preliminary results suggest a gap in population performance that can be closed by improving self-supervised methods and thereby pushing MARL closer to real-world readiness.},

@article{truong_nonmyopic_2024,
 abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular framework for optimizing black-box functions, leveraging probabilistic models such as Gaussian processes. However, conventional BO assumes static query costs, which limits its applicability to real-world problems with dynamic cost structures, such as geological surveys or biological sequence design, where query costs vary based on previous actions. To address this, we propose a cost-constrained nonmyopic BO algorithm that incorporates dynamic cost models. Our method employs a neural network policy for variational optimization over multi-step lookahead horizons to plan ahead in dynamic cost environments. Empirically, we benchmark our method on synthetic functions exhibiting a variety of dynamic cost structures. Furthermore, we apply our method to a real-world application in protein sequence design using a large language model-based policy, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness in handling multi-step planning in a large and complex query space. Our nonmyopic BO algorithm consistently outperforms its myopic counterparts in both synthetic and real-world settings, achieving significant improvements in both efficiency and solution quality.},
