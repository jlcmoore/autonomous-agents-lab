We use our understanding of human learning to create artificial intelligence that learns more like people do. In turn, we use artificial intelligence and other technologies to model and assist human learning, and we apply the sorts of computational principles we work with in other areas that might benefit people. Because we have plenty of intuition on the settings in which learning thrives, we'll look to have fun, grow, and get enough sleep while we're at it.
